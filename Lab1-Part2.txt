1. No，we can't remove it. It says:"rm: cannot remove ‘test1’: Is a directory"

2. Yes,we can remove it.

3. rm -r test1/test2

4.HelloWorld

5./home/ugrad/jack123/public_html/cs103/lab1/part1  It shows my current location in the remote main frame of BU.

6.There are w files in test3 folder: test4.txt and test5.txt.

7.
folder test1: drwxr-xr-x  
It's a directory that allows owners to list files ,create files,move files and access files in the directory.
It allows the group of people to whom the directory belongs(cs-ugrad) and all other people in the World wide Web
to list and access files in the directory but they cannot create or move files in or out.

file test1.txt:  -rw-r--r--
It's a file that allows the owners to read,copy and write the file, and also allows the group of people to whom the directory belongs(cs-ugrad)
and all other people in the WorldWideWeb to read and copy the files. No one else can read or write or execute files.

8. Only the owners of the folder.

9. Everyone, including owners ,the group of people to whom the directory belongs(cs-ugrad) and all other people in the World wide Web.

10. test1 and test 2:drwxr-xr-x
    test1.txt and test2.txt: -rw-r--r--

11. test1:drwxrwxr-x
    test1.txt:-rwxrwxr--
    test2: drwxr-x---
    test2.txt: -rw-r-----
    
12.We can see test1,test1.txt and test2.txt but not test2 folder.
   test 2 directory's access right doesn't have "r"(list files permission) for others(other people in the World Wide Web) 
   so we cannot see the directory in the browser. But we hold the right to see the other 3 files or folders in the browser.

13. It's all right when I click on test1.txt but it says "forbidden to access" on this server when I click on test2.txt.
    The reason is that the access right of test2.txt doesn't allow me to access and read the file of test2.txt.
